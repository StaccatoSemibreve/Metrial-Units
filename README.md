# Metrial-Units
A custom system of units that is combination of Metric and English units. And, for good measure, better for physics than Metric!

## Derivation
There are a few neat coincidences that I will be making use of in Metric and English (/ Imperial / US Customary) systems of units. For relating Metric to English: 1 gram is close to 1 scruple, and 1 yard is about 1 metre. For deriving Metric in the first place, 300 megametres / second is close to the speed of light.

## Metric
The unit of time is the second, left as-is, because while I am opinionated on this matter, this must have parity with metric.

The unit of length is the metre, derived by fixing the speed of light to be exactly 300 megametres / second. This length is equivalent to 0.999 308 current metres.

The unit of mass is the kilogram of 0.996 current kilograms, derived by fixing the reduced Planck constant (AKA, the quantum of angular momentum) to be exactly 1.06e-34 joule seconds.

The unit of charge is the coulomb of 1.001 current coulombs, which for parity is derived by fixing the elementary charge to 1.6e-19 coulombs.

The unit of temperature exists and has been rederived, but is excluded here for brevity.

### Accuracy of Metric Derived Units
This is a bunch of numbers, probably skip this.

The new hectare is 0.999 current hectares. The new litre is 0.998 current litres. The new metre/second is 0.999 current, as is acceleration. Kilograms/litre are 0.998 current, newtons 0.996, pascals and bars 0.997, joules 0.995, watts 0.995, amperes 1.001, volts 0.994, ohms 0.992.

Basically, it's all pretty accurate for day-to-day purposes.

## English Units
Alright, here's the fun bit! Anything with an asterisk* is something I modified or entirely made up.
